# Voice Enabled Todo App using MERN Stack 
This is a simple MERN Stack application for a Todo List App. \
**Backend**: Express, Node, MongoDB \
**Frontend**: ReactJS, CSS 

## Features:
- Add tasks to the list through text or voice by clicking on the mic icon. Voice input is handled using the Webkit Speech Recognition API.
